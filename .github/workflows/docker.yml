# GitHub Actions workflow: Lint Dockerfile with hadolint and build the image
#
# This workflow runs on pushes and pull requests. It performs two main tasks:
#  - Lints docker/Dockerfile using hadolint (fails the job on lint errors)
#  - Builds the container image with Podman to ensure the Dockerfile is valid
#
# Notes:
#  - The image is built locally for validation only; it is not pushed to any registry.
#  - Permissions are minimized (read-only) since no repository writes occur.
