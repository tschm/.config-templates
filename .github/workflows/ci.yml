# Workflow: Continuous Integration
#
# Purpose: This workflow runs tests on multiple Python versions to ensure
#          compatibility and code quality across different environments.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push and on pull requests to main/master
#          branches (including from forks)
#
# Components:
#   - 🧪 Run tests on multiple Python versions
#   - 🔄 Matrix strategy for testing on different environments
