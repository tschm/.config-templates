pre-configured templates.

> Last updated: November 29, 2025

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **CI/CD Templates** - Ready-to-use GitHub Actions and GitLab CI workflows
- 🧪 **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test setup with pytest
- 📚 **Documentation** - Automated documentation generation
- 🔍 **Code Quality** - Linting, formatting, and dependency checking
- 📝 **Editor Configuration** - Cross-platform .editorconfig for consistent coding style
- 📊 **Marimo Integration** - Interactive notebook support

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tschm/config-templates.git
cd config-templates
```

The project uses a [Makefile](Makefile) as the primary entry point for all tasks.
It relies on [uv and uvx](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management.

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
make install
```

This will:
- Install `uv` and `uvx` into the `bin/` directory
- Create a Python virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Install all project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`

Both the `.venv` and `bin` directories are listed in `.gitignore`.

## 📋 Available Tasks

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

```makefile
Usage:
  make <target>

Targets:

Bootstrap
  install-uv       ensure uv/uvx is installed
  install-extras   run custom build script (if exists)
  install          install
  clean            clean

Development and Testing
  test             run all tests
  marimo           fire up Marimo server
  marimushka       export Marimo notebooks to HTML
  deptry           run deptry if pyproject.toml exists

Documentation
  docs             create documentation with pdoc
  book             compile the companion book
  fmt              check the pre-commit hooks and the linting
  all              Run everything

Release
  release          bump version and create release tag (usage: make release VERSION=1.2.3 or BUMP=patch [BRANCH=main])
  release-dry-run  preview release changes without applying (usage: make release-dry-run VERSION=1.2.3 or BUMP=patch [BRANCH=main])

Meta
  help             Display this help message
```

The [Makefile](Makefile) provides organized targets for bootstrapping, development, testing, and documentation tasks.

## Testing your documentation

Any README.md file will be scanned for Python code blocks.
If any are found, they will be tested in [tests/test_docs.py](tests/test_docs.py).

```python
# Some generic Python code block
import math
print("Hello, World!")
print(1 + 1)
print(round(math.pi, 2))
print(round(math.cos(math.pi/4.0), 2))
```

For each code block, we define a block of expected output.
If the output matches the expected output, a [test](tests/test_readme.py) passes,
Otherwise, it fails.

```result
Hello, World!
2
3.14
0.71
```

## 📁 Available Templates

This repository includes the following configuration templates:

- **ruff.toml** - Configuration for the Ruff linter and formatter
- **.devcontainer/** - Development container configuration
- **.github/workflows/** - GitHub Actions workflow templates
- **Makefile** - Simple make commands for common operations

## 🧩 Usage Examples

You can inject the templates into your project
using one of the methods described below.

### Manual Copy

Copy the desired configuration files to your project:

```bash
# Example: Copy GitHub workflow files
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp config-templates/.github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Using Jebel Quant's [Sync Template Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sync-template)

You can automatically sync these configuration
templates into your GitHub repositories using
the Jebel Quant action:

```yaml
name: Sync Templates

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allow manual triggering

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Sync Template
        id: sync
        uses: jebel-quant/sync_template@v0.3.1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
          source: ".github/template.yml"
          branch: "template-updates"
          commit-message: "chore: sync template files"
```

This workflow will:

1. Download the latest templates based on your template.yml configuration
2. Copy them to your project
3. Create a pull request with the changes (if any)

**Note:** You need to create a `.github/template.yml` file in your repository that specifies
which templates to sync. This file should list the configuration files you want to include from this repository.
Example template.yml:

```yaml
template-repository: "tschm/.config-templates"
template-branch: "main"
include: |
    .github
    taskfiles
    tests
    .editorconfig
    .gitignore
    .pre-commit-config.yaml
    CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    CONTRIBUTING.md
    Makefile
    ruff.toml
    Taskfile.yml
```

## 🖥️ Dev Container Compatibility

This repository includes a
template **Dev Container** configuration
for seamless development experience in
both **VS Code** and **GitHub Codespaces**.

### What's Configured

The `.devcontainer` setup provides:

- 🐍 **Python 3.14** runtime environment
- 🔧 **UV Package Manager** - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- ⚡ **Makefile** - For running project workflows
- 🧪 **Pre-commit Hooks** - Automated code quality checks
- 📊 **Marimo Integration** - Interactive notebook support with VS Code extension
- 🔍 **Python Development Tools** - Pylance, Python extension, and optimized settings
- 🚀 **Port Forwarding** - Port 8080 for development servers
- 🔐 **SSH Agent Forwarding** - Full Git functionality with your host SSH keys

### Usage

#### In VS Code

1. Install the "Dev Containers" extension
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. The environment will automatically set up with all dependencies

#### In GitHub Codespaces

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main" (or your branch)
5. Your development environment will be ready in minutes

The dev container automatically runs the initialization script that:

- Installs UV package manager
- Configures the Python virtual environment
- Installs project dependencies
- Sets up pre-commit hooks

### Publishing Devcontainer Images

The repository includes workflows for building and publishing devcontainer images:

#### CI Validation

The **DEVCONTAINER** workflow automatically validates that your devcontainer builds successfully:
- Triggers on changes to `.devcontainer/**` files or the workflow itself
- Builds the image without publishing (`push: never`)
- Works on pushes to any branch and pull requests
- Gracefully skips if no `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` exists

### VS Code Dev Container SSH Agent Forwarding

Dev containers launched locally via VS code
are configured with SSH agent forwarding
to enable seamless Git operations:

- **Mounts your SSH directory** - Your `~/.ssh` folder is mounted into the container
- **Forwards SSH agent** - Your host's SSH agent is available inside the container
- **Enables Git operations** - Push, pull, and clone using your existing SSH keys
- **Works transparently** - No additional setup required in VS Code dev containers

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when using this configuration template.

---

#### SSH authentication fails on macOS when using devcontainer

**Symptom**: When building or using the devcontainer on macOS, Git operations (pull, push, clone) fail with SSH authentication errors, even though your SSH keys work fine on the host.

**Cause**: macOS SSH config often includes `UseKeychain yes`, which is a macOS-specific directive. When the devcontainer mounts your `~/.ssh` directory, other platforms (Linux containers) don't recognize this directive and fail to parse the SSH config.

**Solution**: Add `IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain` to the top of your `~/.ssh/config` file on your Mac:

```ssh-config
# At the top of ~/.ssh/config
IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain

Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This tells SSH clients on non-macOS platforms to ignore the `UseKeychain` directive instead of failing.

**Reference**: [Stack Overflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75613632/trying-to-ssh-to-my-server-from-the-terminal-ends-with-error-line-x-bad-configu/75616369#75616369)


## 🔧 Custom Build Extras

The project includes a hook for installing additional system dependencies and custom build steps needed across all build phases.

### Using build-extras.sh

Create a file `.github/scripts/build-extras.sh` in your repository to install system packages or dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Example: Install graphviz for diagram generation
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz

# Add other custom installation commands here
```

### When it Runs

The `build-extras.sh` script is automatically invoked during:
- `make install` - Initial project setup
- `make test` - Before running tests
- `make book` - Before building documentation
- `make docs` - Before generating API documentation

This ensures custom dependencies are available whenever needed throughout the build lifecycle.

### Important: Exclude from Template Updates

If you customize this file, add it to the exclude list in your `action.yml` configuration to prevent it from being overwritten during template updates:

```yaml
exclude: |
  .github/scripts/build-extras.sh
```

### Common Use Cases

- Installing graphviz for diagram rendering
- Adding LaTeX for mathematical notation
- Installing system libraries for specialized tools
- Setting up additional build dependencies
- Downloading external resources or tools


## 🚀 Releasing

This template includes an automated release workflow that handles version bumping, tagging, and publishing.

### Quick Release

The easiest way to create a release is using the Makefile:

```bash
# Bump patch version (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
make release BUMP=patch

# Bump minor version (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
make release BUMP=minor

# Bump major version (e.g., 1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
make release BUMP=major

# Set specific version
make release VERSION=1.2.3

# Preview changes without applying (dry run)
make release-dry-run BUMP=patch
make release-dry-run VERSION=1.2.3
```

### What Happens During a Release

When you run `make release`, the following happens automatically:

1. **Version Update** - Updates the version in `pyproject.toml` using `uv`
2. **Commit** - Creates a commit with message `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
3. **Tag** - Creates a git tag `vX.Y.Z`
4. **Push** - Pushes the commit and tag to GitHub
5. **Workflow Trigger** - The tag push triggers the GitHub Actions release workflow

### The Release Workflow

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) then:

1. **Validates** - Checks the tag format and ensures no duplicate releases
2. **Builds** - Builds the Python package (if `pyproject.toml` exists)
3. **Drafts** - Creates a draft GitHub release with artifacts
4. **PyPI** - Publishes to PyPI (if not marked private)
5. **Devcontainer** - Publishes devcontainer image (if `PUBLISH_DEVCONTAINER=true`)
6. **Finalizes** - Publishes the GitHub release with links to PyPI and container images

### Configuration Options

**PyPI Publishing:**
- Automatic if package is registered as a Trusted Publisher
- Use `PYPI_REPOSITORY_URL` and `PYPI_TOKEN` for custom feeds
- Mark as private with `Private :: Do Not Upload` in `pyproject.toml`

**Devcontainer Publishing:**
- Set repository variable `PUBLISH_DEVCONTAINER=true` to enable
- Override registry with `DEVCONTAINER_REGISTRY` variable (defaults to ghcr.io)
- Requires `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to exist
- Image published as `{registry}/{owner}/{repository}/devcontainer:vX.Y.Z`

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Release from a specific branch
make release BUMP=patch BRANCH=main

# Dry run to preview changes
make release-dry-run VERSION=2.0.0 BRANCH=develop
```
